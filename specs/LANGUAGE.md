# LANGUAGE — compiler surface and staging

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-02
- **Refines:** [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md)

## Strategy

Hand-written recursive-descent parser with error recovery — chosen for
student-quality diagnostics and zero dependencies. The parser recognizes more
than the compiler can compile: constructs we plan to support but haven't built
yet produce a **friendly, specific diagnostic** ("`if` statements are not yet
supported by jvmjs") with a source span, never a cryptic parse error. Constructs
outside SCOPE.md entirely (lambdas, streams, modules) get a "not supported by
jvmjs" diagnostic phrased as a scope statement, not a bug.

The full target surface is defined by [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md); this file tracks
what each stage of the compiler actually accepts, starting from the vertical
slice.

## Accepted today (v0 slice + stages 1–8: the full SCOPE.md surface)

- Compilation unit: one or more top-level class declarations (no `package`,
  no `import` — parsed and reported as not-yet-supported, then skipped).
- Class declaration: modifiers, name, `{ ... }` body of method declarations.
- Method declaration: modifiers (`public` / `static` etc.), `void` or named /
  primitive / array return type, parameter list, block body.
- Statements: blocks, expression statements (method calls only, as in Java),
  local variable declarations (`int a = 1, b;`, `final double d = 2.5;`,
  `String s = "hi";`), assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`), and
  statement-position `++`/`--` (prefix or postfix), which lower to
  `+= 1` / `-= 1`.
- Control flow: `if`/`else` (dangling `else` binds inner, like Java),
  `while`, `do`/`while`, `for` (including multi-declarator init,
  comma-separated updates, and `for (;;)`), and unlabeled
  `break`/`continue` binding to the innermost loop. Conditions must be
  `boolean`, and `if (x = 1)` gets a "did you mean '=='?" hint.
  Definite assignment is branch-aware: both `if`/`else` arms assigning
  counts, a lone branch or loop body doesn't, a `do` body does
  (JLS §16-style, conservative on constant conditions).
- Expressions, with Java precedence:
  - literals (`int`, `double`, `String`, `char`, `boolean`, `null`), with
    `-2147483648` folding so `Integer.MIN_VALUE` is writable;
  - local variable reads;
  - arithmetic `+ - * / %` and unary `-` with binary numeric promotion
    (JLS §5.6.2), 32-bit wrapping int semantics, `ArithmeticException` on
    int division by zero, IEEE double semantics (`Infinity`, `NaN`);
  - comparisons `< <= > >= == !=` (numeric, boolean equality, and reference
    equality on strings — literals are interned, so the classic `==` vs
    `equals` lesson works) with Java NaN behavior;
  - short-circuit `&&` / `||` and `!`;
  - primitive casts `(int) (double) (char) (boolean)` including Java's d2i
    saturation and i2c truncation;
  - string concatenation with `+`/`+=` (compiled to `StringBuilder` chains),
    formatting `int`/`double`/`char`/`boolean`/`null` exactly as Java does.
- User-defined **static methods**: parameters, `return` (with javac-style
  missing-return and unexpected-return checks via a reachability-lite
  analysis, so `while (true) { ... return ...; }` needs no trailing return),
  recursion and mutual recursion (guarded by `StackOverflowError`, see
  RUNTIME.md), bare same-class calls and `ClassName.method(...)` across
  classes/files, results usable in any expression or discarded as a
  statement. Overload resolution follows JLS §15.12.2 without boxing:
  applicable-by-widening, exact match preferred, unique most-specific
  method, javac-worded ambiguity/cannot-find-symbol/non-static errors.
- Callable surface: the above, plus `System.out` / `System.err`
  `print` / `println` with zero arguments or one argument of any supported
  expression type.
- Literals: exponent notation (`1e10`, `2.5E-3`) lexes as double.
- **Arrays** (any element of `int`/`double`/`boolean`/`char`/`String`, any
  dimension count): `new T[n]` / `new T[n][m]` / `new T[n][]` (via
  `newarray`/`anewarray`/`multianewarray`), `{...}` initializers in
  declarations and `new T[] {...}` (nested for 2D, ragged rows fine),
  `a[i]` reads/writes with compound assignment and `++`/`--` on elements,
  `a.length` / `m[i].length`, arrays as parameters and returns (rows are
  references — aliasing behaves like Java), reference `==`, and
  `for (T x : array)` desugared to an indexed loop (element widening
  applies; `break`/`continue` work). Runtime exceptions use Java 11's
  wording: `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 5 out of bounds for
length 3`, `NegativeArraySizeException`, `NullPointerException`.
  `main`'s `String[] args` is now fully usable. Printing or
  concatenating a whole array gets a friendly error instead of Java's
  `[I@hash` (revisited when `Object` lands).

- **Classes with state** (stage 5): instance and static fields (with
  initializers, `final`, and Java's default values), constructors with
  overloading and the synthesized default constructor (JLS §8.8.9),
  instance methods with virtual dispatch, `this` (explicit and implicit
  — bare names resolve local → field → static field), `new ClassName(args)`,
  cross-class member access with `private` enforced using javac's wording
  ("x has private access in A", "non-static variable x cannot be referenced
  from a static context"), static fields initialized by a synthesized
  `<clinit>` run lazily on first class use, objects in arrays and as
  parameters (reference semantics, `==` identity), and
  `println(obj)`/concatenation calling `toString()` — null-safely, with the
  VM supplying Java's `ClassName@hex` default when a class doesn't define
  one. `this(...)` constructor chaining, `super`, `extends`, and
  `instanceof` wait for stage 6; String methods (`s.equals(t)`,
  `s.length()`) wait for the class library.

- **Inheritance** (stage 6): `extends` (single), `implements` (multiple),
  `interface` and `abstract class`/`abstract` methods with completeness
  checks in javac's wording ("B is not abstract and does not override
  abstract method go() in A"), method overriding with compatibility checks
  ("f() in B cannot override f() in A") and true polymorphic dispatch
  (including calls made from inherited method bodies), `super.method(...)`,
  `super(...)`/`this(...)` constructor chaining with Java's first-statement
  and field-initializer rules, inherited fields, subtype reference widening
  in assignments/arguments/overloads, `instanceof` (null is false), class
  casts with upcast elision and runtime `ClassCastException` ("class A
  cannot be cast to class B"), and superclass-first static initialization.
  Field hiding is rejected by design; `protected` currently behaves like
  public (no packages).

- **The class library** (stage 7, intrinsics per SCOPE.md):
  - The full Java 11 `String` API over UTF-16 (2026-07-03), because
    students look methods up in documentation and expect them to exist:
    every instance method except the regex family
    (`matches`/`replaceAll`/`replaceFirst`), the stream family
    (`chars`/`codePoints`/`lines`), and `getBytes` — those report an
    honest "String.matches exists in Java, but regular expressions are
    not supported by jvmjs" rather than a misleading cannot-find-symbol.
    Statics: `valueOf` (all overloads incl. `char[]`), `copyValueOf`,
    and `String.format` (2026-07-03) — plus `System.out.printf` and
    `PrintWriter.printf` — via a compiler special-case that synthesizes
    the call descriptor from the actual argument types (the one shape
    the fixed signature tables can't express). The Formatter subset:
    conversions `b B s S c C d o x X e E f g G n % h H`, flags
    `- + 0 , ( #` and space, argument indexes (`%2$s`), width, and
    precision, with Java's exception types and messages
    (`IllegalFormatConversionException: d != java.lang.String`, ...).
    Float conversions round HALF_UP over the shortest-round-trip
    decimal digits, matching Java's `BigDecimal.valueOf` path exactly
    (`%.2f` of `2.675` is `2.68`). `join` still reports the varargs
    limitation. `split` treats its
    delimiter literally, not as a regex (a documented deviation visible
    only for metacharacter delimiters like `"."`), with Java's full
    limit semantics; `intern` preserves reference identity; `hashCode`
    is Java's exact algorithm. With Java 11 exception wording
    (`StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 5`).
    `equals` accepts only strings/null (a documented narrowing of
    `equals(Object)`).
  - The full Java 11 `Math` API for int/double (2026-07-03): trig,
    hyperbolic, log/exp families, `cbrt`/`hypot`/`rint`/`signum`/
    `toDegrees`/`toRadians`/`copySign`/`ulp`/`nextUp`/`nextDown`/
    `nextAfter`/`fma`/`IEEEremainder`/`getExponent`, `floorDiv`/
    `floorMod` with Java's negative semantics, the `xxxExact` family
    throwing `ArithmeticException: integer overflow`, plus `PI`/`E`
    (`round` returns int, not long — the classroom idiom is
    `(int) Math.round(x)` anyway; transcendentals may differ from a
    given JVM by 1 ulp on irrational results, as JVMs differ among
    themselves). `random()` uses Java's LCG,
    seeded deterministically by default (tests) and from host entropy in
    the browser (`VmOptions::random_seed`).
  - The full Java 11 int/double surfaces of `Integer` (radix parsing
    and formatting, the bit-twiddling family, the unsigned family,
    `compare`/`min`/`max`/`sum`/`signum`/`hashCode`, `SIZE`/`BYTES`),
    `Double` (all constants incl. infinities and `NaN`,
    `isNaN`/`isInfinite`/`isFinite`, `compare` with Java's `-0.0 < 0.0`
    and NaN-greatest ordering, bit-exact `hashCode`, `toHexString`),
    `Character` (classification and conversion families with Java's
    own `isWhitespace`-vs-`isSpaceChar` distinction, `digit`/`forDigit`/
    `getNumericValue`, surrogates, radix constants), and `Boolean`
    (including the 1231/1237 hash codes). `valueOf` returns primitive
    values (no boxed identity or caching — a documented deviation).
    Long/float/byte-dependent members report honest "the long type is
    not supported" style errors, with
    `NumberFormatException: For input string: "x"`.
  - `Scanner` over `System.in` (`nextInt/nextDouble/nextBoolean/next/`
    `nextLine/hasNext*` and `close`), tokenizing like Java, fed by the
    host console — in the browser this is the SharedArrayBuffer
    blocking-stdin path. Pattern/regex members, streams, and the
    long/float/byte readers report honest reasons.
  - `ArrayList<E>` with the CSA generics surface: wrapper/String/class
    element types, the diamond, and the full Java 11 method set
    (2026-07-03): `size/add/get/set/remove` (by index and by value),
    `clear/contains/indexOf/lastIndexOf/addAll` (both)/`equals`/
    `hashCode` (Java's 31-fold)/`toString/isEmpty`, plus the capacity
    hints as no-ops; element equality is by value for numbers and
    strings and by identity for objects (correct here, since `equals`
    overriding is not supported). Iterators, lambdas, comparators,
    streams, `toArray`, and `subList` report honest reasons. Autoboxing (a no-op in this VM — boxed-equality caching
    semantics are not modeled), `println(list)` printing `[a, b]`,
    for-each, and `IndexOutOfBoundsException` in Java 11's wording.
    Nested generics (`ArrayList<ArrayList<...>>`) are rejected kindly.
  - `import` statements are real (2026-07-03): declarations are
    validated (unknown class in a known package / unknown package get
    javac's wording; real-but-unmodeled Java classes and packages get
    an honest "not supported by jvmjs" instead), and using `Scanner`,
    `ArrayList`, `File`, or `PrintWriter` without the matching import
    (or a `java.util.*` / `java.io.*` wildcard) is javac's "cannot find
    symbol: class Scanner". `java.lang` is implicit; exception-class
    imports (`IOException`, ...) are accepted for `throws` clauses;
    user-defined classes shadow library names. Fully qualified names
    work without imports (2026-07-03): `java.util.Scanner` in type
    positions (declarations, `new`, generics, `throws`) and
    `java.lang.Math.abs(...)` / `java.lang.System.out.println(...)` /
    `java.lang.Integer.MAX_VALUE` in expressions, with Java's obscuring
    rule (a variable named `java` wins over the package). Unknown
    qualified names get the same javac/honest wording as imports.
    `package` declarations remain unsupported.
  - User classes shadow intrinsic names (a class called `Scanner` wins).

- **File IO over the virtual filesystem** (stage 8): `new File(path)`
  with `exists/isFile/isDirectory/delete/mkdir/createNewFile/getName/`
  `getPath` (`length()` returns int, not long — virtual files are
  small), `new Scanner(file)` slurping VFS content with
  `FileNotFoundException: path (No such file or directory)`,
  `new PrintWriter(path|file)` truncating on open and **writing
  through** (a kind deviation: output is durable even without
  `close()`), and `throws` clauses parsed and ignored (checked
  exceptions are not enforced). The host seeds and inspects files via
  the `JvmSession` VFS API, so JS ⇄ Java file exchange works.

- **Exceptions** (2026-07-03): `try` / multi-`catch` with JVMS
  exception tables, `throw`, and `new SomeException("message")` over the
  closed library hierarchy in `jvmjs-classfile::exceptions`
  (`Throwable` down through `Exception`/`Error`/`RuntimeException` to
  the concrete classes the runtime throws — `StackOverflowError` is
  catchable via `Error`, matching Java). Subtype catching, cross-frame
  unwinding, rethrow, `getMessage()`/`toString()`, javac's "exception X
  has already been caught" for masked clauses, JLS definite-assignment
  and completes-normally rules (a method whose try and catch both
  return has no missing-return error). `finally` works via javac's
  duplication strategy (2026-07-03): copies on the normal path, each
  catch, every `return`/`break`/`continue` that exits the try, and a
  catch-all rethrow handler; loop-depth tagging keeps `break` from
  running guards outside its loop, and copies are never covered by
  their own catch-all. User exception classes extend the library
  throwables (`class TooSmall extends Exception` with `super(message)`
  chaining, own fields and methods, inherited `getMessage`/`toString`);
  thrown user objects keep their identity through catch and rethrow.
  Uncaught behavior is unchanged:
  Java-formatted stderr with a line-numbered stack trace captured at
  the throw point.

- **Expressions & switch** (2026-07-03): the conditional operator
  `?:` (with numeric promotion and reference joining), `switch` over
  int/char/String (fall-through, stacked labels, default anywhere,
  `break` binding to the switch while `continue` skips past it to the
  enclosing loop; javac's "duplicate case label"; lowered to an
  evaluate-once compare chain — semantically identical to
  tableswitch), expression-position `++`/`--` on variables and array
  elements (JVMS dup/dup_x sequences; field targets remain
  statement-only for now), the bitwise and shift operator family
  `& | ^ ~ << >> >>>` with Java precedence, compound forms, shift-count
  masking, and non-short-circuit `& | ^` on booleans, plus hex
  (`0x1F`), binary (`0b1010`), octal (`0755`), and underscore
  (`1_000_000`) integer literals and `\uXXXX` escapes.

- **The `long` type** (2026-07-03): literals with `L` (decimal and
  hex/binary up to 64 bits) and `d`/`D` double suffixes, JLS numeric
  promotion (int op long → long, long op double → double), implicit
  int→long and long→double widening with javac's lossy-conversion
  errors the other way, explicit casts in every direction, the full
  arithmetic/bitwise/shift set (six-bit shift-count masking, `LCMP`
  comparisons, wrapping overflow), `long[]` arrays, `++`/`--`,
  compound-assignment narrowing (`int += long`), switch-selector
  rejection in javac's wording, `%d`/`%x` formatting, concat and
  println, the `Long` wrapper class, `Math`/`Double` long members
  (`toIntExact`, `multiplyHigh`, `doubleToLongBits` family — formerly
  honest-error stubs, now real), `Scanner.nextLong`, and
  `System.currentTimeMillis`/`nanoTime` via a host clock
  (`ConsoleIo::now_millis`; JS `Date.now()` in the browser).

- **The `float` type** (2026-07-03): `f`/`F` literals, JLS promotion
  (`long op float → float`, `float op double → double`), widening
  int/char/long→float→double with lossy-conversion errors otherwise,
  casts in every direction, f32-precision arithmetic (`0.1f + 0.2f`
  is `0.3`, not `0.30000000000000004`), `FCMPL`/`FCMPG` NaN
  comparisons, `float[]`, the `Float` wrapper class with the bits
  functions and Java's total-order `compare`, `Math` float overloads,
  `Scanner.nextFloat`, and `%f`-family formatting via `doubleValue()`
  widening. Rendering matches OpenJDK 11's FloatingDecimal — which is
  NOT shortest-round-trip (pre-Ryū): a clean-room implementation
  (`crates/jvmjs-vm/src/floatdec.rs`) validated against a 25k-value
  reference corpus (`tools/FloatCorpus.java`), byte-identical on
  99.94% including every value ordinary programs produce; the residue
  is exotic subnormal bit patterns, documented in the corpus test.

- **The `short` and `byte` types** (2026-07-03): stored as ints (the
  JVM way), with the full conversion discipline — JLS §5.2 constant
  narrowing (`byte b = 5;` compiles, `byte b = 200;` is javac's lossy
  error), `I2B`/`I2S` truncating casts from every numeric type,
  compound-assignment and `++`/`--` implicit narrow-back with
  wraparound (`byte b = 126; b++; b++;` is -128), arithmetic promoting
  to int, `byte[]`/`short[]` with true element semantics (`bastore`
  truncates; byte arrays are distinct from boolean arrays on the
  heap), switch selectors, `Byte`/`Short` wrapper classes with javac's
  out-of-range `NumberFormatException`, `Scanner.nextByte/nextShort`
  (range-checked `InputMismatchException`), and `%x` formatting that
  masks to the argument width (`%x` of `(byte) -1` is `ff`, not
  `ffffffff`).

- **Labeled `break`/`continue`** (2026-07-03): `label: statement`
  prefixes, with `break label;` jumping past the labeled loop, switch,
  or block, and `continue label;` continuing the named enclosing loop.
  The loop-target stack carries the source label; targeting searches
  it innermost-out. javac's exact diagnostics for the error cases
  (`undefined label: x`, `not a loop label: x`). Sibling scopes may
  reuse a label independently.

- **Initializer blocks** (2026-07-03): `static { ... }` blocks run in
  the synthesized `<clinit>`, and instance `{ ... }` blocks run in
  every constructor after `super(...)` — both interleaved with their
  field initializers in source order (JLS §12.4.2 / §12.5), tracked by
  a per-class textual-order counter. `this(...)` delegation runs the
  instance initializers exactly once (in the delegated-to
  constructor); static blocks run exactly once at class init. Each
  block is its own local scope.

- **`enum` types** (2026-07-03): desugared to an ordinary class whose
  constants are `static final` singletons instantiated in source order
  in `<clinit>`. Supports constants with constructor arguments, enum
  fields/methods/constructors (user constructors gain the two implicit
  leading `name`/`ordinal` parameters), and the standard members
  `values()` (fresh array each call), `valueOf(String)` (javac's `No
enum constant E.X` `IllegalArgumentException` on miss), `ordinal()`,
  `name()`, and a default `toString()` returning the name (all
  overridable). `switch` on an enum matches unqualified constant names
  by reference identity; enum constants are singletons so `==` works.
  `@Override` and other annotations are parsed and ignored.

Everything else parses into a not-yet-supported diagnostic with recovery, so a
file full of future-Java still reports one clear message per construct.
Value-position `++`/`--` (e.g. `y = x++`) is parsed and rejected with a
friendly message for now.

## Codegen choices

- Class file format: major version 55 (Java 11), as fixed in
  `jvmjs-classfile`.
- String concatenation compiles to `StringBuilder` chains (javac-8 style), not
  `invokedynamic`/`StringConcatFactory` — keeps the VM free of `indy` support.
- No `StackMapTable` emission (see [RUNTIME.md](RUNTIME.md) — our VM is the
  only verifier).
- Constructors emit the implicit `Object.<init>` super call followed by
  instance-field initializers, and a default constructor is synthesized when
  none is declared — matching javac's shape.

## Staging (each stage flips its diagnostics to real support)

1. ~~Local variables, assignment, arithmetic/comparison/logical operators,
   string concatenation.~~ **Done (2026-07-02).**
2. ~~Control flow: `if`/`else`, `while`, `for`, `break`/`continue`.~~
   **Done (2026-07-02)** — plus `do`/`while`. Labeled break/continue and
   `switch` remain out for now; for-each arrives with arrays (stage 4).
3. ~~Static methods with parameters and returns (user-defined), recursion.~~
   **Done (2026-07-02)** — verified against OpenJDK 11 by the differential
   suite (`crates/jvmjs-vm/tests/differential.rs`), which runs identical
   programs through `javac`+`java` and jvmjs and requires byte-identical
   stdout.
4. ~~Arrays (1D, then 2D), `for-each`.~~ **Done (2026-07-02)** — both
   dimensions at once, differential-verified against OpenJDK 11.
5. ~~Objects: fields, constructors, `new`, instance methods, `this`.~~
   **Done (2026-07-02)** — plus static fields/`<clinit>` and private-access
   enforcement, differential-verified against OpenJDK 11.
6. ~~Inheritance: `extends`, `super`, overriding, polymorphic dispatch;
   `interface` / `abstract`.~~ **Done (2026-07-02)** — plus `this(...)`
   chaining and `instanceof`, differential-verified against OpenJDK 11.
7. ~~Generics as far as `ArrayList<E>` requires (erasure, autoboxing).~~
   **Done (2026-07-02)** together with the intrinsic class library
   (String/Math/Integer/Double/Scanner/ArrayList), differential-verified
   against OpenJDK 11 including Scanner over piped stdin.
8. ~~`java.io.File` + readers/writers over the virtual filesystem.~~
   **Done (2026-07-02).** The SCOPE.md surface is fully covered.

The staging order optimizes for what CSA course units need earliest.
