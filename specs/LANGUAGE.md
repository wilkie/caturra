# LANGUAGE — compiler surface and staging

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-02
- **Refines:** [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md)

## Strategy

Hand-written recursive-descent parser with error recovery — chosen for
student-quality diagnostics and zero dependencies. The parser recognizes more
than the compiler can compile: constructs we plan to support but haven't built
yet produce a **friendly, specific diagnostic** ("`if` statements are not yet
supported by jvmjs") with a source span, never a cryptic parse error. Constructs
outside SCOPE.md entirely (lambdas, streams, modules) get a "not supported by
jvmjs" diagnostic phrased as a scope statement, not a bug.

The full target surface is defined by [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md); this file tracks
what each stage of the compiler actually accepts, starting from the vertical
slice.

## Accepted today (v0 slice + stages 1–5)

- Compilation unit: one or more top-level class declarations (no `package`,
  no `import` — parsed and reported as not-yet-supported, then skipped).
- Class declaration: modifiers, name, `{ ... }` body of method declarations.
- Method declaration: modifiers (`public` / `static` etc.), `void` or named /
  primitive / array return type, parameter list, block body.
- Statements: blocks, expression statements (method calls only, as in Java),
  local variable declarations (`int a = 1, b;`, `final double d = 2.5;`,
  `String s = "hi";`), assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`), and
  statement-position `++`/`--` (prefix or postfix), which lower to
  `+= 1` / `-= 1`.
- Control flow: `if`/`else` (dangling `else` binds inner, like Java),
  `while`, `do`/`while`, `for` (including multi-declarator init,
  comma-separated updates, and `for (;;)`), and unlabeled
  `break`/`continue` binding to the innermost loop. Conditions must be
  `boolean`, and `if (x = 1)` gets a "did you mean '=='?" hint.
  Definite assignment is branch-aware: both `if`/`else` arms assigning
  counts, a lone branch or loop body doesn't, a `do` body does
  (JLS §16-style, conservative on constant conditions).
- Expressions, with Java precedence:
  - literals (`int`, `double`, `String`, `char`, `boolean`, `null`), with
    `-2147483648` folding so `Integer.MIN_VALUE` is writable;
  - local variable reads;
  - arithmetic `+ - * / %` and unary `-` with binary numeric promotion
    (JLS §5.6.2), 32-bit wrapping int semantics, `ArithmeticException` on
    int division by zero, IEEE double semantics (`Infinity`, `NaN`);
  - comparisons `< <= > >= == !=` (numeric, boolean equality, and reference
    equality on strings — literals are interned, so the classic `==` vs
    `equals` lesson works) with Java NaN behavior;
  - short-circuit `&&` / `||` and `!`;
  - primitive casts `(int) (double) (char) (boolean)` including Java's d2i
    saturation and i2c truncation;
  - string concatenation with `+`/`+=` (compiled to `StringBuilder` chains),
    formatting `int`/`double`/`char`/`boolean`/`null` exactly as Java does.
- User-defined **static methods**: parameters, `return` (with javac-style
  missing-return and unexpected-return checks via a reachability-lite
  analysis, so `while (true) { ... return ...; }` needs no trailing return),
  recursion and mutual recursion (guarded by `StackOverflowError`, see
  RUNTIME.md), bare same-class calls and `ClassName.method(...)` across
  classes/files, results usable in any expression or discarded as a
  statement. Overload resolution follows JLS §15.12.2 without boxing:
  applicable-by-widening, exact match preferred, unique most-specific
  method, javac-worded ambiguity/cannot-find-symbol/non-static errors.
- Callable surface: the above, plus `System.out` / `System.err`
  `print` / `println` with zero arguments or one argument of any supported
  expression type.
- Literals: exponent notation (`1e10`, `2.5E-3`) lexes as double.
- **Arrays** (any element of `int`/`double`/`boolean`/`char`/`String`, any
  dimension count): `new T[n]` / `new T[n][m]` / `new T[n][]` (via
  `newarray`/`anewarray`/`multianewarray`), `{...}` initializers in
  declarations and `new T[] {...}` (nested for 2D, ragged rows fine),
  `a[i]` reads/writes with compound assignment and `++`/`--` on elements,
  `a.length` / `m[i].length`, arrays as parameters and returns (rows are
  references — aliasing behaves like Java), reference `==`, and
  `for (T x : array)` desugared to an indexed loop (element widening
  applies; `break`/`continue` work). Runtime exceptions use Java 11's
  wording: `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 5 out of bounds for
length 3`, `NegativeArraySizeException`, `NullPointerException`.
  `main`'s `String[] args` is now fully usable. Printing or
  concatenating a whole array gets a friendly error instead of Java's
  `[I@hash` (revisited when `Object` lands).

- **Classes with state** (stage 5): instance and static fields (with
  initializers, `final`, and Java's default values), constructors with
  overloading and the synthesized default constructor (JLS §8.8.9),
  instance methods with virtual dispatch, `this` (explicit and implicit
  — bare names resolve local → field → static field), `new ClassName(args)`,
  cross-class member access with `private` enforced using javac's wording
  ("x has private access in A", "non-static variable x cannot be referenced
  from a static context"), static fields initialized by a synthesized
  `<clinit>` run lazily on first class use, objects in arrays and as
  parameters (reference semantics, `==` identity), and
  `println(obj)`/concatenation calling `toString()` — null-safely, with the
  VM supplying Java's `ClassName@hex` default when a class doesn't define
  one. `this(...)` constructor chaining, `super`, `extends`, and
  `instanceof` wait for stage 6; String methods (`s.equals(t)`,
  `s.length()`) wait for the class library.

Everything else parses into a not-yet-supported diagnostic with recovery, so a
file full of future-Java still reports one clear message per construct.
Value-position `++`/`--` (e.g. `y = x++`) is parsed and rejected with a
friendly message for now.

## Codegen choices

- Class file format: major version 55 (Java 11), as fixed in
  `jvmjs-classfile`.
- String concatenation compiles to `StringBuilder` chains (javac-8 style), not
  `invokedynamic`/`StringConcatFactory` — keeps the VM free of `indy` support.
- No `StackMapTable` emission (see [RUNTIME.md](RUNTIME.md) — our VM is the
  only verifier).
- Constructors emit the implicit `Object.<init>` super call followed by
  instance-field initializers, and a default constructor is synthesized when
  none is declared — matching javac's shape.

## Staging (each stage flips its diagnostics to real support)

1. ~~Local variables, assignment, arithmetic/comparison/logical operators,
   string concatenation.~~ **Done (2026-07-02).**
2. ~~Control flow: `if`/`else`, `while`, `for`, `break`/`continue`.~~
   **Done (2026-07-02)** — plus `do`/`while`. Labeled break/continue and
   `switch` remain out for now; for-each arrives with arrays (stage 4).
3. ~~Static methods with parameters and returns (user-defined), recursion.~~
   **Done (2026-07-02)** — verified against OpenJDK 11 by the differential
   suite (`crates/jvmjs-vm/tests/differential.rs`), which runs identical
   programs through `javac`+`java` and jvmjs and requires byte-identical
   stdout.
4. ~~Arrays (1D, then 2D), `for-each`.~~ **Done (2026-07-02)** — both
   dimensions at once, differential-verified against OpenJDK 11.
5. ~~Objects: fields, constructors, `new`, instance methods, `this`.~~
   **Done (2026-07-02)** — plus static fields/`<clinit>` and private-access
   enforcement, differential-verified against OpenJDK 11.
6. Inheritance: `extends`, `super`, overriding, polymorphic dispatch;
   `interface` / `abstract`.
7. Generics as far as `ArrayList<E>` requires (erasure, autoboxing).

The staging order optimizes for what CSA course units need earliest.
